        <sup>1</sup>One of the skills that I have earned is my typing speed skill. <sup>2</sup>I acquired this when I was young and I have always challenged myself to get things done faster and move faster, that is why I also learned how to type faster. <sup>3</sup>I also have musical skills and that includes playing drums and bass. <sup>4</sup>I acquired my drum skill when I was in seventh grade, I learned how to play bass just this year. <sup>5</sup>I learned how to use the sound booth in our church too because I was bored and my church mate taught me how to mix each instrument and devices well. <sup>6</sup>It later on became my secondary service to the Lord because the primary was playing an instrument. <sup>7</sup>When I was in 9th grade, I learned how to use a cheat engine and that became my initial motivation to start learning computers and pursue IT as a course. <sup>8</sup>When I got older, I learned that hacking was not taught in schools but rather on how to use programs to create artificial	intelligence and to make something out of nothing. <sup>9</sup>I acquired basic programming skills when I hit 11th grade. <sup>10</sup>I only improved it when I hit college because the naming convention and structure was not taught in my senior year of high school.<br><br>

        <sup>1</sup>Since I learned the skill of playing drums and bass guitar, I also play them as my daily hobby. <sup>2</sup>I play them whenever I feel sad or playful. <sup>3</sup>Doing this helped me get better emotionally as I continue to live on in this world of ours. <sup>4</sup>I believe that music is also one of the things that people cannot live without. <sup>5</sup>My second hobby is playing video games, especially those that are played offline. <sup>6</sup>Examples of these games are Pokemon, <abbr title="Grand Theft Auto"><u>GTA</u></abbr>, <abbr title="Legend of Zelda"><u>LoZ</u></abbr>, <abbr title="Kingdom Hearts"><u>KH</u></abbr>, It Takes Two, and other console games. <sup>7</sup>I also play online games like Valorant and <abbr title="League of Legends"><u>LoL</u></abbr> whenever someone invites me to play with them because I hate playing competitive games alone. <sup>8</sup>My hobby in terms of sport is playing badminton and table tennis whenever I get bored. <sup>9</sup>When I donâ€™t have anything to do and I refuse to do these hobbies, my favorite hobby is sleeping. <sup>10</sup>Sleeping is the best hobby especially when turning adult because it gives rest to the body and more relaxation than other hobbies.<br><br>

        <sup>1</sup>Ever since I was a child, I wanted to know about how to create a game. <sup>2</sup>I started to get curious because of I saw how amazing and addictive a game can be. <sup>3</sup>I chose IT as my future profession because I wanted to be a game developer and create games on my own. <sup>4</sup>I also invest my interest in database and organizing task because there are many categories of data I have in my mind. <sup>5</sup>I want to practice more in handling data and organizing information so that my mind may be clear and data won't be complex or messy. <sup>6</sup>It also will be important when creating game, because data of players will be handled so that their data may not be deleted or disorganized. <sup>7</sup>I also have an interest with knowing about music theory because of my talent in music. <sup>8</sup>I want to know about keys people sing and what theories it has so that I can master tones and learn or improve some of my singing skill. <sup>9</sup>Lastly, even though I already know some part of sound mixers, I still have an interest in knowing more and practice my hearing skills so I will know what part of the music device has a problem or if it sounds bad. <sup>10</sup>Having a talent like this will make me have more right in mixing musical instruments' volume, crispiness, and to know how to put more bass in each.
